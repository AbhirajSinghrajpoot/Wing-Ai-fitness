## 🛡️ Security-First Approach
As a developer with a cybersecurity mindset, data protection is paramount in this application:
 * **Zero Client-Side Keys:** All AI and third-party API calls are strictly executed server-side. No sensitive API keys ever reach the browser.
 * **Encrypted Storage:** Passwords are salted and hashed using bcrypt (10 rounds) before hitting the database.
 * **Data Sanitization:** The password_hash is explicitly stripped from all API responses to prevent data leaks.
 * **Stateless Auth:** Secure session management utilizing HTTP-only, cryptographically signed JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

## 🚀 Local Development Setup
**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/AbhirajSinghrajpoot/arogyamitra.git](https://github.com/AbhirajSinghrajpoot/arogyamitra.git)
cd arogyamitra

```
**2. Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install

```
**3. Environment Configuration:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env

```
Open the .env file and populate it with your API keys:
 * **Groq/Gemini:** For AI coach generation.
 * **YouTube Data API v3:** For fetching exercise tutorials.
 * **Google/GitHub OAuth:** For authentication and calendar sync.
 * **JWT Secret:** Generate a strong 32-character hex key.
**4. Run the application:**
```bash
npm run dev

```
The application will spin up at http://localhost:3000.
## ☁️ Deployment (Render)
This project is optimized for deployment on Render.
 1. Connect this repository to a new Render Web Service.
 2. Build Command: npm install && npm run build
 3. Start Command: npm start
 4. **Important:** Because this app uses SQLite, ensure you attach a **Persistent Disk** on Render so your database survives redeployments.
